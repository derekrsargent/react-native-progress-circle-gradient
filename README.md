## Roadmap

- Add support for children components (e.g. Text)
- Add support for when progress > 100%
- Add support for prop overloading 

## Steps to Create Package

Create library scaffolding using `npx create-react-native-library react-native-progress-circle-gradient`. And select the `JavaScript Library` option. When uploading a package to the npm registry it will first look at the `.gitignore` for files to exclude. You can also create a `.npmignore` file but note that will not be joined with the `.gitignore` file (it will now *only* look at the `.npmignore` file). The best way to tell npm would files to include is to list them in the `files` property in `package.json`.
